Here are my notes from this year's scout day at Indiana University.  

**Devin Taylor - LF**  
The biggest name to come out of IU since Kyle Schwarber. Physical frame, currently 6’0” 215, not much more projection here. Above average raw power, gets into all of it with the loft in his swing, and has plus bat to ball skills to go along with it. Pitch identification is above average, doesn’t chase a ton, swings at pitches he can drive. A complete hitter, no major flaws, not super projectable but present skills are strong. Fringe average athlete, profiles best in left field as the arm isn’t great either, though he showed solid reads in center. There isn’t much in the way of defensive value to fall back on here, but the bat is really impressive and he should have no issue clearing the higher offensive bar for corner outfielders even if he doesn’t have the prototypical build of a Major League corner outfielder. Not sold on him being a Top 10 pick, more of a middle of the first round guy, but one of the best hitters in the class, just held back a bit due to the defense.  
  
Hit - 60 Power - 55 Def - 40 Run - 40 Arm - 40  

**Korbyn Dickerson - CF/RF**  
Drafted in 2021 by the Minnesota Twins in the 20th round. Turned them down, didn’t play freshman year, saw limited playing time last year, and then transferred to IU for this season. Stands 6’1” 190, athletic frame, probably doesn’t add a ton more weight but is twitchy. Above average runner. Slight open stance, keeps his hands near his head, simple toe tap and simple load, bit of a bat wrap at times but relatively clean operation that has cleaned up a fair amount since high school. Solid hitter overall, some issues with breaking stuff, quality of contact can be hit or miss. Above average raw power, gets to most of it in game. Defensively, he spent time in center during scout day and he will stay there long term. Above average range, makes strong reads to the ball, plus arm strength. Slow start to the career so far but I think he pops in a big way this year. The floor is pretty high given his athleticism and defensive capabilities, and the offensive skill set is well rounded enough to project him as an everyday center fielder.  
  
Hit - 45 Power - 50 Def - 60 Run - 55 Arm - 60  

**Jasen Oliver - 2B**  
Draft eligible sophomore for 2025. Played in 49 games as a true freshman, 10 homers (T3 on team). Not super physical, 5’11” 180ish, lean frame, still has room to grow physically. Squat stance with a medium high leg kick, whippy bat speed, twitchy in general. Roughly average raw power now, gets to most of it in game. Fringe average arm, decent range that plays best at second base. Confident player in the field, like his enthusiasm for the game. Had issues with breaking balls this past year as a freshman, more of a bat to ball issue than a pitch ID one and as he gets more experience I think that this will become less of an issue. Well rounded player across the board, no one tool stands out to me as plus but the sum of the parts is impressive. Second division starter potential.  
  
Hit - 50 Power - 50 Def - 50 Run - 50 Arm - 45  

**Tyler Cerny - SS/2B**  
Was draft eligible last year as a sophomore but went unselected. Two year starter at IU, had a horrible summer on the Cape but has done well at IU so far. Tall, wiry frame, 6’2” 195, fairly athletic guy, has physical project left. Decent bat speed, middling raw power. Pretty concerned about his hit tool. Below average approach at the plate, chase happy especially against offspeed, bat to ball skills are also lacking. Current shortstop, has solid range and decent arm strength, probably profiles better at second though at the big league level. Utility infield potential, want to see the approach at the plate improve.  

Hit - 30 Power - 40 Def - 50 Run - 50 Arm - 50

**Ryan Gilbert - 1B/OF**  
High profile high school draft prospect in 2021 out of Ohio. Went undrafted, and was planning on going to IU but had a life threatening illness (something to do with his intestines I think) and was sidelined for a couple years. XXL frame, had dropped to 150 during his illness but he has regained nearly all of his strength and weight. Played a couple games at Bryan and Stratton JC last year, this is his first full season of collegiate baseball. Impressive that he came back at all, but he’s a legit prospect still with 70 grade raw power. Swing and miss is a massive issue though, no feel for breaking stuff yet, has timing issues with velocity. Hard to say how much of it is due to long layoff since playing competitively, but these were the same issues I saw with him when he was in high school. Profiles in a corner outfield spot, above average arm, runs well. The hit tool might make him completely unplayable, but the power is there and he is worth following.  

Hit - 30 Power - 70 Def - 40 Speed - 50 Arm - 55  

**Will Eldridge - RHP**  
Transfer from Indiana Wesleyan. Strong frame, 6’4” 210, well developed lower half that doesn’t have much more projection. FB in the low to mid 90’s, carry through the zone with a flat vertical approach angle, has some tailing action on it as well. Has two distinct slider shapes, a cutter in the upper 80s (2950 RPM) and a more traditional mid 80s slider with two plane break. Also showed a CH that played well with the FB during warmups, didn’t throw in the one inning I saw, flashed average. Exclusively out of the stretch, H3/4 arm slot, clean arm action, repeats the delivery fairly well. Scattershot command, has no history of throwing strikes consistently, but has the arsenal depth to start. #5 starter profile, middle of the bullpen type pitcher if he can’t throw enough strikes.  

FB - 55 SL - 55 CT - 50 CH - 45 CMD - 40  

**Gavin Seebold - RHP**  
Transfer from Southern Indiana. Undersized righty, 6’1” 210. Pitch mix isn’t overpowering, fastball sits 91-93 with some arm side run, changeup in the mid 80’s that mirrors fastball fairly well. Best pitch is his mid 80’s slider, two plane movement, has decent bite, really has a good feel for locating it glove side. H3/4 arm slot, clean delivery he repeats well. Stuff is fringy, but I liked the arm action and command enough to want to follow him in the spring as a late round senior sign option with a chance to start.  
  
FB - 45 SL - 45 CH - 40 CMD - 55  

**Holton Compton - RHP**  
Transfer from Rend Lake (JUCO). XXL frame, 6’6” 230, strong, physical guy without a ton of projection left. Fastball was 91-94 with some arm side run. Liked his upper 70’s splitter, has late break with some depth, only threw a couple times in his one inning of work. Other breaking ball is a low 80’s slider, traditional shape, decent depth and bite. Command is shaky, profiles as a mid leverage bullpen arm.  

FB - 50 SL - 45 SPL - 50 CMD - 40
