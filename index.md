I am a first year Master's student in Statistics at Indiana University. I received B.A.'s in Economics and Mathematics from Indiana University in 2022. In between, I worked at NISA Investment Advisors in St. Louis, MO.   

This summer, I will be joining the Boston Red Sox as a Summer Analytics Intern.
  
Previously, I used to write at Down on the Farm [Down on the Farm](https://downonthefarm.substack.com/). I have also given talks at the SABR Analytics Conference (2021) and Saberseminar (2023).
