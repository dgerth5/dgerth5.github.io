I am a first year Master's student in Statistics at Indiana University. I received B.A.'s in Economics and Mathematics from Indiana University in 2022. In between I worked at NISA Investment Advisors in St. Louis, MO. 

Outside of school I am an active baseball researcher. You can find a lot of my work at https://downonthefarm.substack.com/. I have also given talks at the SABR Analytics Conference (2021) and Saberseminar (2023).
