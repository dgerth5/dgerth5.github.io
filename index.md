I am a second year Master's student in Statistics at Indiana University, graduating in December 2025. I received B.A.'s in Economics and Mathematics from Indiana University in 2022. In between, I worked at NISA Investment Advisors in St. Louis, MO.   

This past summer, I was a Baseball Analytics intern for the [Boston Red Sox](https://www.mlb.com/redsox/), working with the Player Evaluation Team.
  
Previously, I was a contributor at [FanGraphs](https://www.fangraphs.com/blog-roll?author=200880), primarily writing about the MLB Draft. I also wrote at [Down on the Farm](https://downonthefarm.substack.com/) and have given talks at the SABR Analytics Conference (2021) and Saberseminar (2023).
