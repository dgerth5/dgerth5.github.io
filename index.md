Currently I am an Assistant, Amateur Scouting with the [Boston Red Sox]([https://www.mlb.com/redsox/](https://www.mlb.com/redsox/team/front-office)). Previously I was a Baseball Analytics Intern with the Red Sox. Prior to the Red Sox, I worked at NISA Investment Advisors in St. Louis, MO for two years.  

I went to Indiana Univeristy for my undergrad (2022, BA Econ/Math) and master's (2025, Statistics). Outside of work, I was a contributor at [FanGraphs](https://www.fangraphs.com/blog-roll?author=200880), primarily writing about the MLB Draft. I also wrote at [Down on the Farm](https://downonthefarm.substack.com/) and have given talks at the SABR Analytics Conference (2021) and Saberseminar (2023).
